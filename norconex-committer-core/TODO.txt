
- Store failing docs in a separate folder so they are not re-attempted over
  and over.

- Rename maxRetryWait to retryDelay to avoid confusion.
- Add init and close methods.
- Have listeners for commit events.  
- Have a "clearQueue" method.
- Have a "clearRepository" method.
- Allow for multiple committers (and remove MultiCommitter?)
- Committer server (and a committer "client" that can round-robin between 
  committer servers?)


- Maybe: have a way to "route" documents to the proper committer based on 
  metadata field values. Either by having a "restrictTo" equivalent to those 
  found in Importer handlers, or else.
  This has to account for deletions, that do not have metadata properties, so
  could break the routing.  Maybe sending the deletion to all defined committers
  for deletions could do it.  

- Create a Spreadsheet Committer, with support for how to join multi-values.

- Add committer server

- Add chainable committers??
