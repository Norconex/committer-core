

- Do a memory committer queue and test swapping one for the other behaving
  just fine.

- Ensure no workDir collision (either in this project or caller).  Append
  committer index in case of multiple committers (or always)?

- Have installer for other committer?

- Committer server (and a committer "client" that can round-robin between 
  committer servers?)

- Add chainable committers??
